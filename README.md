# Project Overview: Algorithmic Trading Backtesting Framework

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Develop a modular and extensible Python-based framework for backtesting algorithmic trading strategies.
* Integrate robust risk management techniques into the backtesting process.
* Provide a platform for researching and evaluating quantitative trading ideas.
* Serve as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in financial engineering, risk management, and software development (particularly Python).

## Architecture

The framework is structured into the following main modules:

* **`data/`:** Stores historical financial data.
* **`notebooks/`:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
* **`src/`:** Houses the core Python source code, organized into:
    * **`backtester/`:** The engine responsible for running backtests.
    * **`strategies/`:** Implementations of various trading strategies.
    * **`risk_management/`:** Implementations of different risk management techniques.
    * **`data_loader.py`:** Script for downloading and managing data.
    * **`utils.py`:** Utility functions used across the framework.
* **`results/`:** Stores the output of backtests, including performance reports and visualizations.
* **`docs/`:** Contains project documentation (this directory).

## Design Choices

* **Modularity:** The framework is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new strategies and risk management techniques by creating new classes that inherit from the base classes.
* **Python-based:** Python was chosen due to its extensive libraries for data science, finance, and numerical computation (e.g., pandas, numpy, yfinance, matplotlib).
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The use of classes (e.g., `BaseStrategy`, `BaseRiskManager`, `Backtester`) promotes code reusability and organization.

## Integration with Financial Engineering and Risk Management Concepts

This project directly applies concepts learned from the Columbia University Financial Engineering and Risk Management Professional Certificate by:

* **Pricing Models (Implicit):** Strategies will implicitly or explicitly use price data and potentially more advanced pricing concepts for derivatives in future extensions.
* **Term Structure and Credit (Basic):** The risk management module can incorporate basic interest rate considerations for discounting and potentially simulate credit-related events.
* **Optimization Methods:** Risk management techniques like dynamic position sizing aim to optimize risk-adjusted returns.
* **Derivative Pricing (Future):** The framework can be extended to backtest strategies involving options and other derivatives, requiring the implementation of pricing models.
* **Computational Methods:** Python and its libraries are central to data handling, strategy implementation, backtesting, and performance analysis.
